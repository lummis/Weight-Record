Darkening Mondays results in a value entered Monday night (say, 11:15pm) being darkened which wasn't the intention
not very good because a Monday value could be missing or present more than once

get a better name for messageText

On the note textField, "Correction" is intentionally OFF because when it is ON a list of wordy warnings
are generated when text is entered into the field. It looks like one warning for each word in the note, and
evey time 'space' is input the entire note is checked again. The stack exchange page that said to turn this off also
says to turn off "Spell Checking" but that seems to have no effect for me. Of course with "Correction"
OFF there is no autocorrection.

When "All Exceptions" breakpoint is set after not triggering many times I now get a C++ break thrown
every when in AppDelegate. So it's turned off for now but I'd like to know what it's about.

A UIImage added to the background of a textField is ignored if the textField has its border style set to roundedRect, 

This version has the problem than the weightBorderV appears a few points left of where it should be on the
first screen. Actually what seems to be happening is that weightL gets shifted right between "...willDisplay cell:"
when the view is actually drawn on the screen, but the weightBorderV is drawn at the place determined programmatically.
The result is that the border is not drawn symmetrically around weightL on the first screen but looks correct on
subsequent screens (i.e., it looks right if the user scrolls, even if he scrolls up and then back down to the early rows).
After spinning wheels for a few days trying to find out why/when this is happening I will next try drawing the weightL
and the weightBorderView all at once and pass it to the viewController as a single object. If its position on a cell gets
shifted the border should still be symmetrical around the weightL.

commentDisplayL was removed (commented out) in the course of debugging the shifting weightL problem.
