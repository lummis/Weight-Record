Darkening Mondays results in a value entered Monday night (say, 11:15pm) being darkened which wasn't the intention
not very good because a Monday value could be missing or present more than once

get a better name for messageText

On the note textField, "Correction" is intentionally OFF because when it is ON a list of wordy warnings
are generated when text is entered into the field. It looks like one warning for each word in the note, and
evey time 'space' is input the entire note is checked again. The stack exchange page that said to turn this off also
says to turn off "Spell Checking" but that seems to have no effect for me. Of course with "Correction"
OFF there is no autocorrection.

When "All Exceptions" breakpoint is set after not triggering many times I now get a C++ break thrown
every when in AppDelegate. So it's turned off for now but I'd like to know what it's about.

If a textField has border style set to roundedRect, putting a UIImage into the background property
is ignored
