get a better name for messageText

On the note textField, "Correction" is intentionally OFF because when it is ON a list of wordy warnings
are generated when text is entered into the field. It looks like one warning for each word in the note, and
evey time 'space' is input the entire note is checked again. The stack exchange page that said to turn this off also
says to turn off "Spell Checking" but that seems to have no effect for me. Of course with "Correction"
OFF there is no autocorrection.

When "All Exceptions" breakpoint is set after not triggering many times I now get a C++ break thrown
every time in AppDelegate. So it's turned off for now but I'd like to know what it's about.

A UIImage added to the background of a textField is ignored if the textField has its border style set to roundedRect,


buttonA enabled all the time
At start
   state = .entering
   buttonA title = "Enter Weight"

buttonA when title is "Enter Weight"
   state = .outOfRange
   title changes to "Cancel"
   weightTF enabled

each entry into weightTF
   if weight value is inRange
      state = .inRange
      buttonA title changes to "Save"
   if weight value is not valid
      state = .outOfRange
      buttonA title changes to "Cancel"
